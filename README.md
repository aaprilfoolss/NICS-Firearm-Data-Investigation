This is a final project submission for Udacity's 'Introduction to Data Analysis with Python and NumPy' course.

The aim of this project is to complete the entire data analysis process, from generating questions all the way through communicating results. The skills demonstrated are as follows:
Use a Juptyer Notebook for data analysis tasks, Explore and inspect data using NumPy and pandas, Manipulate data using NumPy and pandas, and Present conclusions about data using pandas visualizations.

I chose to use the NCIS Firearm Background Check dataset (along with U.S. census data) curated by Udacity for my project, and set out to answer the following questions: Which states have had the highest growth in gun registrations? What census data is most associated with high gun per capita?
